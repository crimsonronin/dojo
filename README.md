This repo is now depreciated. It is replaced by http://github.com/zoopcommerce/pixie. Pixie works almost exactly the same, but you don't need ssl to access the repository, and it supports symlinking into a public directory.

A package repository to allow dojo and dojo related packages to install with composer.
